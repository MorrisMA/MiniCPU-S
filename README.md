General Description
-------------------

This project is provides a minimal CPU implementation targetted at CPLDs.

Memory and I/O is supported using SPI-compatible serial EEPROMS, serial FRAMs,
and serial I/O devices.

In its current state, the instruction set has been defined and the RTL for a
serial ALU has been developed.

It is provided as a core. Several external components
are required to form a functioning processor: (1) memory, (2) interrupt controller,
and (3) I/O interface buffers. The Verilog testbench provided demonstrates
a simple configuration for a functioning processor implemented with the M65C02
core: M65C02_Core. Currently, the core provided here only executes the original op-codes
of the WDC 65C02 processor, and not the extended instructions of the current WDC
W65C02S synthesizable core. (In addition to the original 65C02 instructions, the
WDC W65C02S also implements the BBSx, BBRx, SMBx, and RMBx instructions introduced
by Rockwell in the R65C02, and additional instructions introduced by WDC in its
65C802/65C816 microprocessors.)

The core handles an interrupt signal, which external logic asserts after it processes
any interrupts that it provides. That is, the core accepts and performs
the interrupt trap processing, but the external logic must implement the type of
interrupt (maskable or non-maskable), and provide the vector to the core. This
implementation is different than the original processor's in that an indirect
jump through a predetermined address is not performed by the core. The implementation
envisioned is that the external interrupt controller records the vectors for reset
(RST), the non-maskable interrupt (NMI), or the maskable interrupt (IRQ) and
provides the apropriate vector when requested by the core.

The core assumes that the external memory is implemented as an asynchronous
memory device, and as a result, the core expects that the memory will accept an
address and return the read data at that address in the same cycle. It also
expects that addresses and write data from the core will be accepted in the same
cycle. The core does provide an external transfer acknowledge signal, Ack, that
external logic may use to extend memory cycles.

The core provides a large number of status and control signals that external
logic may use. It also provides access to many internal signals such as all of
the registers, A, X, Y, S, and P. The Mode, RMW, SC, and Done status outputs 
may be used to provide additional signals to external devices. Mode provides an
indication of the kind of instruction being executed:

    0 - internal/single cycle (INC/DEC A, TAX/TXA, SEI/CLI, etc.),
    1 - memory access (LDA/LDX/LDY, STA/STX/STY/STZ, INC abs, etc.),
    2 - stack access (PHA/PLA, PHX/PLX, PHY/PLY),
    3 - jump/branch (JMP, BRA, Bcc),
    4 - subroutine call (JSR),
    5 - subroutine return (RTS/RTI)
    6 - break (BRK)
    7 - Invalid (all undefined op-codes)

RMW indicates that a read-modify-write instruction will be performed. External
logic can use this signal to lock memory.

SC is used to indicate a single cycle instruction.

Done is asserted during the instruction fetch of the next instruction. In many
cases, the execution of each instruction is signalled by Done on the same cycle
that the next instruction op-code is being read from memory. Thus, the M65C02
core demonstrates pipelined behaviour, and as a result, tends to execute many
65C02 instructions in fewer clock cycles.

The external bus transaction is signalled by IO_Op. IO_Op signals data memory
writes, data memory reads, and instruction memory reads. Therefore, external
logic may implement separate data and instruction memories and potentially
double the amount of memory that an implementation may access. Using Mode it is
also possible for stack memory to be separate from data and instruction memory.

Synthesis
---------

The objective for the core is to synthesize such that the FF-FF speed is 100 MHz
or higher in a Xilinx XC3S200AN-5FGG256 FPGA using Xilinx ISE 10.1i SP3. In that
regard, the core provided meets and exceeds that objective. Using the settings
provided in the M65C02.tcl file, ISE 10.1i tool implements the design and
reports that the 9.091 ns period (110 MHz) constraint is satisfied.

The ISE 10.1i SP3 implementation results are as follows:

    Number of Slice FFs:            310
    Number of 4-input LUTs:         746
    Number of Occupied Slices:      480
    Total Number of 4-input LUTs:   755 (9 used as route-throughs)

    Number of BUFGMUXs:             1
    Number of RAMB16BWEs            2   (M65C02_Decoder_ROM, M65C02_uPgm_V3)

    Best Case Achievable:           9.035 ns (0.056 ns Setup, 0.976 ns Hold)
